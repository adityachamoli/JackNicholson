          In his private life, Nicholson is notorious for his inability to "settle down," with a place on Maxim's "Top 10 Living Legends of Sex" list. He has fathered six children by five different
          women, but has been married just once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholson's only marriage was to The Terror co-star Sandra Knight from 1962 to 1968, though they separated in 1966. The couple had one daughter, Jennifer (born 1963). Jennifer has two sons,
          the second of whom is Duke Norfleet (b. 1999), an actor under the name Duke Nicholson.

          Five Easy Pieces co-star Susan Anspach contended that her son, Caleb Goddard (born 1970), was fathered by Nicholson. Caleb was automatically adopted by Anspach's then-husband Mark Goddard.
          In 1984, Nicholson stated that he was not convinced he is Caleb's father; however, in 1996, Caleb stated that Nicholson had acknowledged him as his son. At some point between 1988 and 1994,
          Nicholson provided financial assistance to put Caleb through college, Around 1998 in a Rolling Stone interview Nicholson finally publicly acknowledged Caleb as his son and stated that they
          get along "beautifully now". Anspach's The New York Times obituary referred to Caleb as "her son, whose father is Jack Nicholson."

          In 1971 and 1972, Nicholson was in a relationship with singer Michelle Phillips, the ex-wife of his best friend Dennis Hopper, during which time she miscarried Nicholson's baby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholson's longest relationship was 17 years with actress Anjelica Huston, from 1973 until 1990. Their on-again, off-again romance included several periods of overlap with other women,
          including former Bond girl Jill St. John and a Danish model Winnie Hollman with whom Nicholson supposedly fathered a child named Honey (born 1981). Even though Nicholson has never publicly
          acknowledged the child.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship ended with Huston when Nicholson had an affair and fathered a child with actress/waitress Rebecca Broussard. They had two children: daughter Lorraine (born 1990) and son
          Raymond (born 1992). The pair split up in 1994, and later that same year, Nicholson supposedly had a daughter, Tessa, with waitress Jeannine Gourin. Nicholson has never acknowledged the child
          publicly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning in late 1990s, Nicholson was involved with actress Lara Flynn Boyle. The two initially broke up in 2000, later reuniting before splitting permanently in 2004, after which Nicholson
          was linked to English supermodel Kate Moss. In 2006, when he was 69, Nicholson dated actress Paz de la Huerta, who is 47 years his junior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholson has stated that children "give your life a resonance that it can't have without them ... As a father, I'm there all the time. I give unconditional love." However, he has also lamented
          that he "didn't see enough of my eldest daughter because I was trying to make a career".

          Nicholson lived next door to Marlon Brando for a number of years on Mulholland Drive in Beverly Hills. Warren Beatty also lived nearby, earning the road the nickname "Bad Boy Drive". After Brando's
          death in 2004, Nicholson purchased his bungalow for $6.1 million, with the purpose of having it demolished. Nicholson stated that it was done out of respect to Brando's legacy, as it had become too
          expensive to renovate the "derelict" building which was plagued by mold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholson's friendship with author-journalist Hunter S. Thompson is described in Thompson's autobiography Kingdom of Fear. Following Thompson's death in 2005, Nicholson and fellow actors Johnny Depp,
          John Cusack, and Sean Penn attended the private memorial service in Colorado.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholson was also a close friend of Robert Evans, the producer of Chinatown, and after Evans lost Woodland, his home, as the result of a 1980s drug bust, Nicholson and other friends of the producer
          purchased Woodland to give it back to Evans.

          Nicholson is a fan of the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Lakers. He has been a Laker season ticket holder since 1970, and has held courtside season tickets for the past 25 years next to the opponent's
          benches both at The Forum and Staples Center, missing very few games. In a few instances, Nicholson has engaged in arguments with game officials and opposing players, and even walked onto the court.
          He was almost ejected from a Lakers playoff game in May 2003 after he yelled at the game's referee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nicholson is a collector of 20th-century and contemporary art, including the work of Henri Matisse, Tamara de Lempicka, Andy Warhol and Jack Vettriano. In 1995, artist Ed Ruscha was quoted saying that
          Nicholson has "one of the best collections out here".
